1st Deliverable: Scanner


File Description:
This is where the scanner determines what each individual lexeme is. For the
purposes of this assignment, the scanner only FINDS the lexemes, it does NOT
tokenize them. This is the job of the tokenizer. We are aware that it is
possible to tokenize upon finding each lexeme, but have chosen not to so that
the implementation and debugging of the future sections of the interpreter is
easier. Thus, the scanning will be abstracted out from the eyes of the
tokenier, which will produce the desired result.

Note: All python files are pep8/pycodestyle compliant.

'''
list of symbols that are separators, just like whitespace.
'''
symbols = ['{', '}', '(', ')', '[', ']', '.', '"', '*', '\n', ':', ',', ';',
           '+', '-', '>', '<', '/']


'''
special cases where a keyword is two symbols and might be accidentally
scanned as two different lexemes. As far as we're concerned, BASIC does not
include any of these, but the capability will be left just in case.

We originally included this because SCL DOES have double symbol separators.

doubleSymbols = ['..', ':=']


# SEPARATORS houses all possible special separators
SEPARATORS = symbols + doubleSymbols
